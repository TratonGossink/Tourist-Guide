# Tourist-Guide

The Tourist Guide app is designed to give brief descriptions of famous locations around the world. 

This app was developed as a project within my iOS course for learning SwiftUI with multi screen apps. 
Developing this project was an exciting experience of understanding how easy and useful SwiftUI is to work with. 
This project utilized features such as - Scrollview, JSON parsing and Map links. Using map links, I gained knowledge of switching between apps within the iPhone. 
This was fun project that allowed me to gain further excitement to build more apps with SwiftUI.
